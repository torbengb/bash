# bash
A collection of my bash scripts that others might find useful.

I am just starting out with programming (if you can even call it that when referring to shell scripts) and don't have much experience. 

Unless otherwise noted, my code is made available under the Creative Commons license "CC BY-SA 4.0" (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) because I think I understand it, and it gives the public the most freedom (as in speech) to use, alter, and share my work.

I welcome any and all feedback, especially criticism, especially in a civil tone. Thanks for reading!
